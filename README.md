A medication reminder with cycled treatment support

## Introduction

Nevermind provides more advanced ways of scheduling your medicine intakes. With the innovating *treatment cycle* support, it suits better for some long-term medicine management scenarios.

A treatment cycle is a configured period of time (days, weeks or months) that repeats through the whole treatment. For instance in a cytostatic treatment, a cycle is probably two or three weeks. The patient may take some of the medicines only on the first several days of each cycle, while other medicines everyday. Nevermind makes such complex scheduling possible.
